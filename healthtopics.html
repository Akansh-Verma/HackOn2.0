                <h2>Safer Activities</h2>
                <p>When choosing safer activities, consider how COVID-19 is spreading in your community, the number of people participating in the activity, and the location of the activity.In general, the more closely you interact with others and the longer that interaction, the higher the risk of COVID-19 spread.
                If you decide to engage in public activities, continue to protect yourself by practicing everyday preventive actions. Keep these items on hand when venturing out: a face mask, tissues, and a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, if possible.</p>
                <p>If you want to spend time with people who don’t live with you, outdoors is the safer choice! You are less likely to be exposed to COVID-19 during outdoor activities, even without the use of masks. Stay at least 6 feet apart from people who don’t live with you. Limit your time around others
                Remember bring a mask with you to put on when you encounter people who may get closer than 6 feet, Follow local mask mandates</p>

Research provides growing evidence that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines offer similar protection in real world conditions. COVID-19 vaccination is an important tool to help stop the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 vaccination helps protect people from getting sick or severely ill with COVID-19 and might also help protect people around them. To receive the most protection, people should receive all recommended doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. Some people who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 will still get sick because no vaccine is 100% effective. Experts continue to monitor and evaluate how often this occurs, how severe their illness is, and how likely a vaccinated person is to spread COVID-19 to others. Indian government recommends you get a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as one is available to you.</p>

All COVID-19 vaccines that are in development are being carefully evaluated in clinical trials and will be authorized or approved only if they make it substantially less likely you will get COVID-19. Based on what we know about vaccines for other diseases and early data from clinical trials, experts believe that getting a COVID-19 vaccine also helps keep you from getting seriously ill even if you do get COVID-19. Getting vaccinated yourself may also protect people around you, particularly people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. After you are fully vaccinated for COVID-19, you may be able to start doing some things that you stopped doing because of the pandemic. For example, you can gather indoors without masks with other people who are fully vaccinated.</p>

Keeping distance from other people is especially important for people who are at higher risk for severe illness, such as older adults and those with underlying medical conditions.
                Indoor spaces are more risky than outdoor spaces where it might be harder to keep people apart and there’s less ventilation. </p>
                <p>Activities are safer if - You can maintain at least 6 feet of space between you and others. COVID-19 spreads easier between people who are within 6 feet of each other. They are held in outdoor spaces. Indoor spaces with less ventilation where it might be harder to keep people apart are more risky.
                People are wearing masks. Interacting without wearing masks also increases your risk.</p>
